# NN_Pruning
Compressing a Model with Pruning

In this project, I trained a ResNet18 model on CIFAR10 dataset and compress the model using global 
pruning. Additionally, I compared the compressed models’ performance with the original model and 
explained the learning rate’s effect on the accuracy and inference time in the Experiments section. 

In this study, I used the following ResNet implementation:
